Data Cleanup & Analysis

Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

The sources of data that you will extract from.
The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.


Project Report

At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:


Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, MySQL, etc).
Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.


Please upload the report to Github and submit a link to Bootcampspot.
